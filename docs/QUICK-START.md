# Quick-Start Guide

Welcome to the quick-start guide!
This will guide you through the steps to making your first part on the CNC Lathe.

First, there are a few housekeeping and technical things you need to get out of the way
before you can really get started.

1. Follow the guide in [docs/mach3/MACH3-SETUP.md](/docs/mach3/MACH3-SETUP.md) to
   install and configure the Mach3 program.

2. Follow the guide in [docs/fusion360/FUSION-SETUP.md](/docs/fusion360/FUSION-SETUP.md) to
   install and configure Fusion360 for use with this lathe.

Go and do those, then come back here.
