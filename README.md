# CNC-lathe-docs

Welcome to the Wheaton High School CNC Lathe documentation!
This document was created and maintained by Wheaton students to make sure that people can use the lathe after we’re gone.

This machine is a [Boxford Dueti Turn & Mill CNC Lathe and Milling Machine](https://ostiatools.co.uk/product/boxford-dueti-turn-mill-cnc-lathe-milling-machine-usb-230v-with-software/).
Its a combined CNC lathe and mill. More specs can be found [here](https://img01.techsoft.co.uk/f/pg/Boxford%20Combined%20CNC%20Lathes%20and%20Mills.pdf).

## WIP

### These docs are a work-in-progress!

Many things have yet to be documented, and in fact, much of that is because
we, the creators of these docs, are not yet experts.

## How to use these docs

The lathe requires knowledge and skills across three domains:

1. **The physical lathe itself.** You will need to understand how the lathe works,
   such as its tooling, its very basic operation, and other things about the machine.
   Docs on this subject can be found in the [docs/lathe](/docs/lathe) folder.

2. **Fusion360** for Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)
   _It is possible to use other software, like OnShape, to CAD,
   and it is possible to write your own G-Code,
   but these docs will assume you are using Fusion360._
   Docs on this subject can be found in the [docs/fusion360](docs/fusion360) folder.

3. **Mach3** for controlling the lathe.
   Mach3 is a piece of software that runs on Windows computers and is necessary to control
   all aspects of the lathe, such as moving it around and running programs.
   Docs on this subject can be found in the [docs/mach3](docs/mach3) folder.

We recommend starting by following the [quick-start](docs/QUICK-START.md) guide, which will help you
make your first part on the lathe.
After you understand the basics, you can move onto reading the more advanced documentation.
